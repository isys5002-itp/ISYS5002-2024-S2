It involves a detailed examination of the code to discover why it does not behave as expected. Debugging is a critical skill in software development, as it allows developers to quickly pinpoint bugs and ensure the application runs smoothly. The process typically follows these steps:\n",

It can be broadly categorized into three types:\n",
